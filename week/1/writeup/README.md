After discovering the complex security problems in ECU firmware, I think it is the auditor’s ethical responsibility to first inform their boss first and give the company the option and time to make the responsible decision and patch the security flaws.  If it becomes clear that the company is unwilling to postpone the release of the ECU, I believe it is ethical to release detailed information about the security flaws to both consumer watchdog groups and the public in order to force the company to make the necessary security patches; however, it is only ethical to do this if the ECU is not yet released and in use.   The reason it is ethical to leak information before the release is that the leaked information might lead to the fixing of the security problems which in turn might save lives, while a leak after release makes what otherwise might be an overlooked security flaw in the large sea of technology into a glowing sign saying the vehicle could be exploited.  In turn, the leak may directly lead to the injury of a consumer.  
I believe that if the auditor reports any security flaws they find when auditing to their boss, they have done the ethically responsible thing.  It is not the auditor’s ethical responsibility to then leak the information if the company decides not to patch the security flaw.  The reason being that just because they have the power to possibly force the company to make the patch by releasing information about the vulnerability does not mean he ethical has to because it is asking the auditor to go beyond the duties he was assigned to and then take on legal risks by leaking information.  Because the auditor has completed and correctly reported his audit the ethical responsibility of making sure the security flaw gets fixed has moved from the auditor to the company.  On the other hand, though, if the auditor does not report the security flaw they are consciously ignoring the responsibility given to them to find security flaws and thus are putting consumer in danger.
