## Assignment 4 Writeup

### Part 1 (45 pts)
The flag I found was: CMSC389R-{p1ng_as_a_$erv1c3}
The way I obtained the flag was through command line injection, which is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on teh host operating system via a vulnerable application.  In this case the vulnerable application was Cornerstone Airlines uptime system.
Before I could start the attack I ran the command:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

### Part 2 (55 pts)
